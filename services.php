    <h2> More About Our Services </h2>
    <p>The University of Vermont, located in downtown Burlington, is the most diverse area in Vermont. The mayors fear that more and more young people are leaving the state for more cosmopolitan cities. In the last decade, Vermont has been pushing for more diversity. This is also reflective in the policies and the commitments in college and universities of Vermont. Vermont and Africa are two very different places. Vermonters enjoy living standards that are luxurious compared to what many Africans. Although they were among the first arrivals, the the Sudanese are not the only Africans who have taken up residence in Vermont.</p>
    <p>The cold, winter climate is also  vastly different from the climate in Africa. Then, there are also polarities of race, wealth and technology. For example, the University of Vermont integrate “diversity and equity and human resource functions into strategically, purpose-driven initiatives and services, we support a culture of excellence at UVM that is diverse and inclusive.” In 2001, the "Lost Boys" made journeys to Vermont from squalid camps in Kenya. They were refugees who fled the civil war in southern Sudan.</p>
    <p>A growing number of young Vermonters are also traveling to Ghana, Uganda, Tanzania and other sub-Saharan countries on service-learning trips sponsored by St. Michael's College and other local academic institutions. Somali women, people from Afghanistan, Burma, Syria and such were new arrivals to the state. Despite an immigrants, most Vermonters are white. In fact, according to the national census, 96.9 percent of Vermont of white. The mayors fear that more and more young people are leaving the state for more cosmopolitan cities. In the last decade, Vermont has been pushing for more diversity. This is also reflective in the policies and the commitments in college and universities of Vermont. In addition, Africa-focused programs at churches, schools and colleges around the state are introducing Vermonters to the cultures and histories of countries that are at once horrifyingly poor and enviably rich. Vermont's indigenous tradition of tolerance, together with the cosmopolitan outlook, has primed the state to become a safe harbor for Africans cut adrift from their homelands.</p>
