                            <p>Average Arctic sea ice extent for November set a record low, reflecting unusually high air temperatures, winds from the south, and a warm ocean. Since October, Arctic ice extent has been more than two standard deviations lower than the long-term average. Antarctic sea ice extent quickly declined in November, also setting a record low for the month and tracking more than two standard deviations below average during the entire month. For the globe as a whole, sea ice cover was exceptionally low.</p>

            <h1><strong>How do we function?</strong></h1>
            <p><ol><li>We do not receive any money from any external sources yet.</li>
                <li>We fund raise among ourselves to help each other when we have to respond to a financial or
                    any other crisis.</li>
                <li>As we go, we plan on conduction fundraisings in participating in different events (expeditions,
                    conferences, workshops…. and use the collected funds to finance our charitable activities.</li>
                <li>All members reside in Vermont so far and as of today, we have been struggling in keeping our
                    mutual alive for various reasons:
                    <ol><li>Many of our members moved out of state.</li>
                        <li>Members are full time students and most of times also full time workers. Consequently,
                            our ability to meet has lessened. We use to meet 3 to 4 times per month, but due to the
                            reasons above, we are now down to one meeting a month.</li>
                        <li>Meetings are held at the member’s place, on a rotating basis</li>
                        <li>No one is getting paid nor receiving any kind of compensation for the work done.</li>
                    </ol></li>
