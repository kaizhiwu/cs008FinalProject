                            <h5>2018</h5>
                            <p>Average Arctic sea ice extent for November set a record low, reflecting unusually high air temperatures, winds from the south, and a warm ocean. Since October, Arctic ice extent has been more than two standard deviations lower than the long-term average. Antarctic sea ice extent quickly declined in November, also setting a record low for the month and tracking more than two standard deviations below average during the entire month. For the globe as a whole, sea ice cover was exceptionally low.</p>

            <h1><strong>How do we function?</strong></h1>
            <p> 1. We do not receive any money from any external sources yet.
              2. We fund raise among ourselves to help each other when we have to respond to a financial or
                    any other crisis.
              3. As we go, we plan on conduction fundraisings in participating in different events (expeditions,
                    conferences, workshops…. and use the collected funds to finance our charitable activities.
              4. All members reside in Vermont so far and as of today, we have been struggling in keeping our
                    mutual alive for various reasons:
                    a. Many of our members moved out of state.</li>
                    b. Members are full time students and most of times also full time workers. Consequently,
                            our ability to meet has lessened. We use to meet 3 to 4 times per month, but due to the
                            reasons above, we are now down to one meeting a month.</li>
                    c. Meetings are held at the member’s place, on a rotating basis</li>
                    d. No one is getting paid nor receiving any kind of compensation for the work done.</li>
