        <h1><strong>Our Goals:</strong></h1>
        <p>1. To serve Africans coming from anywhere on the continent; to be open to any individuals.
            who recognize themselves in our motto, regardless of their race, ethnic group, age, sex, 
            religious or political affiliation, and sexual orientation </p>
        <p>2. To help the newcomers adjust to the American lifestyle.</p>
        <p>3. To be as much as possible involved in each aspect of the American life.</p>

        <h1><strong>Our Vision:</strong></h1>
        <p>1. Provide social assistance/services that include but are not limited to case management, help with transportation, translation and interpretation services, provide modest cash money for emergency needs…</p>

        <p>6. Extend the scope and venue (national and international) of our charitable activities to other organizations in the long run.</p>

        <h1><strong>How do we function?</strong></h1>
        <p>1. We do not receive any money from any external sources yet.</p>
        <p>2. We fund raise among ourselves to help each other when we have to respond to a financial or
            any other crisis.</p>
        <p>3. As we go, we plan on conduction fundraisings in participating in different events (expeditions,
            conferences, workshops…. and use the collected funds to finance our charitable activities.</p>
        <p>4. All members reside in Vermont so far and as of today, we have been struggling in keeping our mutual alive for various reasons:</p>
        <p>  a. Many of our members moved out of state.</p>
        <p>  b. Members are full time students and most of times also full time workers. Consequently,our ability to meet has lessened. We use to meet 3 to 4 times per month, but due to the reasons above, we are now down to one meeting a month.</p>
        <p>  c. Meetings are held at the member’s place, on a rotating basis</p>
        <p>  d. No one is getting paid nor receiving any kind of compensation for the work done.</p>
