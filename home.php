    <p>We the MAC are a group of refugees who came to the US almost a decade ago. Since our arrival, we have faced many different challenges: social, linguistic, professional, financial, medical, cultural differences, and more; which led us to put together our effort and strength to support each other and survive. Informally, we used to meet on a regular basis for years in order to share our experiences, when we finally decided to make official our action, we got registered in 2011. </p>
