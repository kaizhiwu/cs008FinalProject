<h1><strong>Our Goals:</strong></h1>
                    <p><ol><li>To serve Africans coming from anywhere on the continent; to be open to any individuals.
              who recognize themselves in our motto, regardless of their race, ethnic group, age, sex,

</p>
<h1><strong>How do we function?</strong></h1>
                    <p><ol><li>We do not receive any money from any external sources yet.</li>
			<li>We fund raise among ourselves to help each other when we have to respond to a financial or
any other crisis.</li>
			<li>As we go, we plan on conduction fundraisings in participating in different events (expeditions,
conferences, workshops…. and use the collected funds to finance our charitable activities.</li>
			<li>All members reside in Vermont so far and as of today, we have been struggling in keeping our
mutual alive for various reasons:
<ul><li>Many of our members moved out of state.</li>
    <li>Members are full time students and most of times also full time workers. Consequently,
our ability to meet has lessened. We use to meet 3 to 4 times per month, but due to the
reasons above, we are now down to one meeting a month.</li>
    <li>Meetings are held at the member’s place, on a rotating basis</li>
    <li>No one is getting paid nor receiving any kind of compensation for the work done.</li>
</ol></li>
